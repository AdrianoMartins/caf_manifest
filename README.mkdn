Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android AOSP/CAF Build, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository, use a command like this:

    repo init -u https://github.com/AdrianoMartins/caf_manifest.git -b android-5.1

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
